# Dice-project
The 'Dicee' project is a web-based dice game crafted during a Udemy course, employing fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface consists of two dice, each representing a player. Upon page refresh, the dice display random numbers, simulating rolls. The application dynamically updates to declare the winner based on the higher dice roll.
